# BFS Project (made out of boredom,)

This repo was born during a moment of boredom lol
If you're reading this, you're probably curious too — welcome.

## What's inside

- `src/main/java/graph/Graph.java` — a minimal adjacency-list implementation for a graph with integer nodes.
- `src/main/java/graph/BFS.java` — just some BFS written by hands like at the (g)old times without ai
- `src/main/java/graph/Main.java` — a tiny example that builds a graph, prints neighbors and runs BFS starting from node `1`.

## Why I made this

Because it was entertaining. 

## How to try it (macOS / zsh)
Just run the Main.java 
You should see printed the best path for the commented graph.

## BFS starting point
In `Main.java` there's a line `int start = 1;` — change it if you want to run BFS from another node.
